\description{
Add a writer function for a specific format
}
\details{
Adds a writer for a given format. The writer is added to a list of writers
referenced by the format. The writer function should accept 'data' with
the data as its first argument, 'resourcename' the name of the resource to
which the data set belongs, 'datapackage' that datapackage to which the data
should be written.

Note that adding a writer for an existing format will overwrite the existing
writer
}
\examples{
# Add a very simple writer for json
json_writer <- function(data, resourcename, datapackage, ...) {
  dataresource <- dpresource(datapackage, resourcename)
  path <- dppath(dataresource, fullpath = TRUE)
  jsonlite::write_json(data, path)
}

dpaddwriter("json", json_writer)

}
