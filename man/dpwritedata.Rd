\usage{
dpwritedata(x, ..., write_codelists = TRUE)

\method{dpwritedata}{datapackage}(
  x,
  resourcename,
  data,
  writer = "guess",
  ...,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the Data Package or Data Resource to which the data is to be written
to.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are passed on to the writer function.}

\item{write_codelists}{write both the data set \code{x} itself and any
code lists of fields in the data set.}

\item{resourcename}{name of the Data Resource in the Data Package to which
the data needs to be written.}

\item{data}{\code{data.frame} with the data to write.}

\item{writer}{the writer to use to write the data. This should be either a
function accepting the Data Package, name of the Data Resource, the data and
the \code{write_codelists} argument or the character string \code{"guess"}.}

\item{datapackage}{the Data Package to which the data needs to be written.}
}
\value{
The function doesn't return anything. It is called for it's side effect of

\description{
Write  data of resource to file
