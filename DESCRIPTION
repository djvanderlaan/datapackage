Description: Open, read data from and modify Data Packages. Data Packages are
    an open standard for bundling and describing data sets
    (<https://datapackage.org>). When data is read from a Data Package care is
    taken to convert the data as much a possible to R appropriate data types.
    The package can be extended with plugins for additional data types.
